# Secret Sauce

Create a secret message, set a password, and have it encrypted. Give the encrypted URL to your friends. Only those with the same unique URL and password will be able to open and read the message.

## Specs

Using Mocha and Chai! Make sure to `npm install` and then just open up `spec.html` to see the specs in action.

## Technical

There are two main JS files, the encoder.js which encodes the secret message and password into a unique and encrypted URL, and a decoder.js which handles the decoding of the encrypted URL.

The index.html is where the user enters the message and password, and the decode.html is where the use decodes the message.
